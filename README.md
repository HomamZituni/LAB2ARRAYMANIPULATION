Reflection Lab 2
1.	How did array methods like push() and filter() help you manipulate data in this activity?   
They help manage data by allowing you to add items and filter allows you to easily search for items.
I was able to add and filter items easily once the program was functioning. 
3.	What challenges did you face when trying to filter and search for items in the array?
Making the search case-insensitive was quite hard especially converting the array items and the search term lowercase.
Ensuring the filter function returned the correct result was also a challenge. Debugging both issues was quite challenging to solve with the time given.
5.	How would you modify this code to make it more efficient or user-friendly?
Using “Set” was an option I found in documentation to prevent duplicates instead of what I wrote. But I was not sure how to implement it.
Maybe implementing live search could help like they have at amazon.com. Error messages for duplicates probably would be helpful too.
